def tree_map_tensor(fn: Callable[[Tensor], Tensor], tree: PyTree) -> PyTree:
	"""Apply `fn` to every `torch.Tensor` leaf in `tree`, leaving non-tensor leaves unchanged.

	You can use this function to transform only the tensor leaves of a PyTree [1] structure without
	disturbing the non-tensor leaves. The function wraps `fn` with an identity pass-through for
	non-tensor values and delegates structural traversal to `torch.utils._pytree.tree_map` [2].

	Parameters
	----------
	fn : Callable[[Tensor], Tensor]
		A function to apply to each `torch.Tensor` leaf in `tree`.
	tree : PyTree
		A nested Python structure such as a tuple, list, or dictionary containing a mix of
		`torch.Tensor` values and other Python objects.

	Returns
	-------
	mappedTree : PyTree
		A PyTree with the same structure as `tree`, where each `torch.Tensor` leaf has been replaced
		by the result of `fn(leaf)` and all non-tensor leaves are unchanged.

	See Also
	--------
	tree_flatten_with_inverse : Flatten a PyTree into a list and return an inverse function.

	Examples
	--------
	Increment only the tensor leaf while preserving non-tensor leaves [3]:

		```python
		from torch import tensor
		from torch_einops_kit import tree_map_tensor

		tree = (1, tensor(2), 3)
		result = tree_map_tensor(lambda t: t + 1, tree)
		# result[0] == 1
		# result[1] == tensor(3)
		# result[2] == 3
		```

	Detach all tensors nested inside a state container [4]:

		```python
		from torch_einops_kit import tree_map_tensor

		nextMemory = tree_map_tensor(lambda t: t.detach(), nextMemory)
		```

def tree_flatten_with_inverse(tree: PyTree) -> tuple[list[Any], Callable[[Iterable[Any]], PyTree]]:
	"""Flatten `tree` into a list of leaves and return a paired inverse function.

	You can use this function to decompose a nested PyTree [1] structure into a flat list of leaves
	and to recover the original nested structure from a modified list. The paired inverse function
	calls `torch.utils._pytree.tree_unflatten` [2] with the `TreeSpec` captured at flatten time, so
	the structure can be reconstructed even after the leaves have been modified.

	Parameters
	----------
	tree : PyTree
		A nested Python structure such as a tuple, list, or dictionary to flatten.

	Returns
	-------
	flattened : list[Any]
		A flat list of all leaves in `tree` in left-to-right traversal order.
	inverse : Callable[[Iterable[Any]], PyTree]
		A function that accepts an iterable of leaves and reconstructs a PyTree with the same
		structure as the original `tree`.

	See Also
	--------
	tree_map_tensor : Apply a function to every tensor leaf in a PyTree.

	Examples
	--------
	Modify a single leaf and reconstruct the original nested structure [3]:

		```python
		from torch_einops_kit import tree_flatten_with_inverse

		tree = (1, (2, 3), 4)
		(first, *rest), inverse = tree_flatten_with_inverse(tree)
		result = inverse((first + 1, *rest))
		# result == (2, (2, 3), 4)
		```
